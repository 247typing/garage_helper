Drill Tap Chart
This tool is used to calculate drill bit size for a specified tap. It also
calculates drill bit sizes for close fit clearance and free fit clearance holes.

Major Diameter:
Enter the major diameter or outside diameter of the screw (screw peak to peak).
Acceptable formats are:
    Integer such as "1" for a 1 in bolt
    Decimal numbers such as "0.250" or ".25" for a 1/4 in bolt
    Fractions such as "1/4" or "13/64"
    Mixed numbers such as "1 1/2" for 1.5 in bolt (note the space between 1 and 1/2)
    Numbered sized such as "#4" or "#10" for a 4-40 or 10-32 machine screw

Pitch (as TPI):
Enter the pitch in the form of TPI or Threads per Inch. This will be converted
to a true pitch and displayed for your information.

Calculations
Tap drill size:
This is determined using the equation (major dia - pitch). This is then rounded
and the next largest drill bit is the closest bit.

Close Fit Clearance:
This is determined using the equation (major dia * 1.03) for a 3% larger hole
than the major diameter.

Free Fit Clearance:
This is determined using the equation (major dia * 1.08) for a 8% larger hole
than the major diameter.
