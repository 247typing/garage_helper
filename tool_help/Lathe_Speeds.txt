Lathe Feeds and Speeds
This tool is used to calculate cutting speeds on a lathe determined by the
material to be cut and the diameter of the material. The output is in revolutions
per minute (RPM). These will be rounded to the nearest whole number but the
closest machine speed should be used.


Material to Cut:
This is a drop down menu with available choices of materials. If a required
material is not listed this may be updated in static_data -> Lathe_Speeds ->
cutting_speeds.csv.

Material Diameter:
Enter the material outside diameter of the work piece.
Acceptable formats are:
    Integer such as "1" for a 1 inch work piece
    Decimal numbers such as "0.250" or ".25" for a 1/4 inch work piece
    Fractions such as "1/4" or "13/64"
    Mixed numbers such as "1 1/2" for 1.5 inch work piece (note the space between 1 and 1/2)

Output in RPM:
The output is calculated using the formula:
(Cutting Speed * 12) / (3.14 * Material Diameter)
